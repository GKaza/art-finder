# art-finder

The project was made with VueJS and Typescript using the [Rijksmuseum API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/).

For styling, TailwindCSS was used as it's a low-level CSS library that fitted completely to the needs of the app and responsive web design implementation.

## Functionality

As a user, you can browse through art in the homepage where you can search for specific keywords, filter results according to your favorite color and sort the results by: artist, age, type or relevance.

When an item is clicked, the user is taken to the details page where more information about the selected piece of art can be viewed.
